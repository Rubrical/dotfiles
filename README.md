# dotfiles
My linux configuration files

## How it works:
- First `git clone git  clone  https://github.com/Rubrical/dotfiles.git`. 

After that, `cd` to the directory, then you must use the command `chmod +x config-setup.sh` and execute it with `./config-setup.sh`. What will happen next is the full configuration of the system. The father directory will not delete itself, and if you already have the same config files it'll be saved as a backup, once the script uses `mv -b`command instead of some kind of `cp`.
